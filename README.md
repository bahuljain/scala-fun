# Scala Fun

Learning Scala

- static types in patterns allowed (wow).

	```scala
	case x : List[Any] =>
	case y : Any =>
	```

- `flatmap` is a complete genius.
- `mkString(sep)` is a similar to join in python. Loved that feature in python.
- `" " * 3` replicates the string 3 times. Very very awesome and useful.
